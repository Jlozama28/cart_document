This part of the project is responsible to display items that can be added, removed
and give the user a total.

the schematic of this part was first to display the items with the quantity, the
name and the price and a workable + and - button.

the part contains two files: main.dart and the cart.dart, all the work and implementations
are done in the cart.dart.
main.dart is link to cart.dart by importing cart.dart library into main.dart.

the main body of the code implementation consists of a listview which created a
work containing the item, the name, the quantity, the price, the add button, the
remove button.
I also implemented the product listview which return a product listview index.
from there, I specify the itemCount which is how many item I wanted to display.

the last part of the prototype contains a subtotal with tax.
